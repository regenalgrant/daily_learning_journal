###8th day:
  - Very tough advance coding.
  - End of day lab with Samm was awesome, he should do that more often.
  - Everyday TAs are helpful.
  - Instruction sometimes a little fast because i am not a typer but i will have to learn soon.
  - My code still doesnt work but will try to get it up and running.
